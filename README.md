# Fort_Worth_Capital_Projects

Personal project to help display data from the Fort Worth Capital Projects list. I felt the data was more useful in a map format in order to better display what information was available. It makes more sense to view this data with a map as most people who are looking up the capital projects want to know what is happening around themselves. 

To do this, I needed to scrape the Fort Worth, Texas website to compile the data of all capital projects. Within the data, there are x and y coordinates provided based on the map view in each project. I am able to take this data and then display each project as a marker on the map. Some projects do not have address information so they are provided in the "Additional Projects" list.
